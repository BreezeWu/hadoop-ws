Hi,
I am unable to install RStudio (64 bit) on red hat linux. The commands used are:
wget http://download2.rstudio.org/rstudio-server-0.98.501-x86_64.rpm
sudo yum install --nogpgcheck rstudio-server-0.98.501-x86_64.rpm
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# installed R from source via:
./configure --with-x=no --enable-R-shlib
make bytecode
make install-libR
make install


After install, I see that R libraries have been installed in /usr/local/lib64:
> ls -1 /usr/local/lib64/R/lib
libRblas.so
libRlapack.so
libR.so

However, when I download the rstudio-server-0.94.92-x86_64.rpm and run:
> sudo rpm -Uvh rstudio-server-0.94.92-x86_64.rpm

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed it!

I first had to install cairo, openssl, gfortran, and pango:

> sudo yum install cairo-1.8.8
> sudo yum install openssl098e-0.9.8e
> sudo yum install gcc41-libgfortran-4.1.2
> sudo yum install pango-1.28.1
(which was determined by running yum whatprovides libcairo.so.2, etc), then I had to make a symbolic link from the installed R binary to another directory:

> sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/R /usr/bin/R
And finally tell rpm to install rstudio while ignoring dependencies:

sudo rpm -Uvh --nodeps rstudio-server-0.94.92-x86_64.rpm
I'm actually not sure that the ignoring dependencies bit was necessary come to think of it.

Matias,

Looks like the version of R we are finding in /usr/local/lib/ was built from source without the --enable-R-shlib option. To get RStudio working, you actually have a couple of options:

1) Remove your current version of R and reinstall with the following command:

$ sudo apt-get install r-base
2) Install R again (with the above command) and then configure the RSTUDIO_WHICH_R environment variable to point to the newly installed version of R. Details of how to do this are described at the bottom of the following document:

I just got it running by adding a soft link in /usr/local/lib/ to the /usr/lib/ one

mydir$ ls -al /usr/local/lib/R/lib
total 2788
drwxr-sr-x 2 root staff 4096 2011-10-20 09:42 .
drwxrwsr-x 11 root staff 4096 2011-06-14 10:26 ..
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root staff 316887 2011-06-14 10:26 libRblas.so
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root staff 2518944 2011-06-14 10:26 libRlapack.so
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root staff 22 2011-10-20 09:42 libR.so -> /usr/lib/R/lib/libR.so

I think I'll live with this hack for now.

I'm a new user of Rstudio, but it seems to be really nicely done. Thanks for this!
