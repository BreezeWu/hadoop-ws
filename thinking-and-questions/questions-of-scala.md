1. 隐式转换(view, LUB), 隐式类, implicit parameters, 隐式对象
2. path-dependent types
3. Scala supports F-bounded polymorphism
4. νObj calculus: Path-dependent types are a novel concept of Scala; their theoretical foundation is provided by the νObj calculus
5. this.type:    this.type is similar to (covariant uses of) Kim Bruce's mytype
6. self-type:   Here, S is called a self-type of class Subject
7. functional type abstraction (aka generics)  vs object-oriented type abstraction (aka abstract types)
8.  family polymorphism
9. Class Linearization
10. algebraic datatypes + use pattern matching  as the basic decomposition principle
11. Some
12. products, which in the standard library include at  least [[scala.Product1]] through [[scala.Product22]]
13. implicit parameters
14. "properly contained": Here a method definition is contractive if the type of every implicit parameter type is "properly contained" [35]
15. Scala’s closure objects
